# CS50
Notes from CS50 course: introduction to computer science

My goal is to finish this course in 25 days.Problem sets and final project is as follow.

Syllabus:(https://docs.cs50.net/2018/x/syllabus.html)

@@@ Week 0: ++ Binary: how to represent a number in binary system (Ie: 1 is 001, 2 is 010, 3 is 011, 4 is 100, 5 is 101). Letters are stored by ASCII (Ie: H is 72, I is 73). For both ASCII and RGB, the maximum value that each character or amount of one color can be is 255, because one common standard group of bits is a byte, or 8 bits. (1 byte = 8 bits ->2^8=256, max 255 ways to represent a character).
            ++ Algorithms: step-by-step instructions on how to solve a problem.
            ++ Pseudocode: layout of a block of code intended for human to read rather than machine. (draft code)
            ++ Compiler: clang xyz.c or make xyz, then run ./xyz.out  
            ++ Other concepts: Boolean expressions. Conditions. Variables. Functions. Arrays. Threads. Events.

@@@ Week 1: <LECTURE 1>
            ++ C: int main(void): main is the standard name in C to indicate that it is the default function in a program               that should be run. include is a keyword that indicates we want to include some other file in our program.                   (standard input/output library). 
            ++ for loops
            ++ functions included in the cs50.h library. (get_char, get_double, get_float, get_int, get_long_long,                       get_string)
            ++ ints.c (Integer arithmetic)
            ++ // comments
            ++ floats.c (float x = get_float("x: ");)
            ++ conditions.c ( if, else if, else)
            ++ noswitch.c (if, else if, else, ==, ||, &&)
            ++ use single quotes around characters, to distinguish them from strings, which we use double quotes to indicate
            ++ a switch is another construct in C where the value of a variable is compared to various cases, and the                   indented code beneath a matching case will be executed.
            ++  overflow.c : integer overflow, a binary number with 8 bits 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0. we donâ€™t have an extra bit to               the left to actually store that larger value. Number excess memory.
